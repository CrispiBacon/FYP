"July 26th, 2012

In my dream, I went into a bizarre dimension with blue spots in terrain, Rocky Black and grey terrain, and a cloudy black sky. I didn't see the sky, but out of nowhere, a powerful being appeared to me, and the sky had a thin plate of volcanic, powerful orange (gaseous like) material. The being spoke to me words with power, which I can't really recall. In my next dream, I was awake, in my bed, and there was an alien there. I was being hooked with wires to my brain, sort of feeding me information. It was feeding me dreams within my own dream, kind of like inception. In this dream thing, I was studying the possible amount of dreams. There was a chart, like the audacity ogg vorbis specs one. There was a limit to dreams and personality, according to the info.

The info I remember is:

Personality: 136,742

Dreams: 144 million or more (relative to your body? Or could it be more?)

There was another dream about school. See, last year, I dropped back in after dropping out from absolute f'ing hell. I usually saw this poor bloke while passing to the next class. Probably 14 or 15, but he barely did anything to warrant any bullying, yet he got so much ♥♥♥♥ for everything. I've probably interacted with the kid 3 times; the 1st was seeing some of my friends trying to cheer him up, the 2nd was seeing him get ♥♥♥♥ed with by some jock idiots, in which I pulled a knife on them and intimidated them into leaving, and the 3rd was where he had this delicate science project, so I basically daunted the idiots in the middle of the hallway into getting to class and made sure that this kid's project wasn't ruined by D-bags.

In my thoughts, I could just see myself at an earlier age in the kid. So, the dream directed my mind into the social 'chart' of the kid and the students in general, in which I just kind of got a broader social look in people; i.e. being able to 'put myself into other people's shoes'. I worked and thought and came up with a moral that I really need to reach that kid and prevent anything bad from happening, because I don't want someone to have to deal with the mentality that can develop from that.

The dream flashed to another dream, which was a type of mind probe in a way. I just felt like I was being read. I was having to face my own flaws in a very disturbing and hostile state of REM.

I kind of woke up and still felt the alien type thing (Probably caused from human natural DMT from last sentence) glaring at me. It kind of had that 'snobby' or arrogant type of personality seen from some reports of aliens. While I woke up, that thing kind of faded off probably due to the release of DMT stopping.

Just for reference, I haven't done DMT or LSD. I've been clean from any type of drug (Tobacco / Alcohol / weed) for 3 months before that dream.","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

"I think the college system and american society needs a massive change. I don't see the point in dishing out $30k a year just to get into college, only for most people to either drop out or get a useless degree, or something they're not entirely interested in.

I don't think everything should be free, but there's one thing that absolutely must be - Education. Primary and Secondary school is free for students, which is excellent because every human deserves the chance and the right to be educated.

Yet in college, most the time it's going into a huge room with a hundred other students,taking notes of what the professor says, and then studying your ass off to try to actually pass the class. A lot of times, the teachers aren't even good at teaching in the first place.

Yet in Elementary ~ High, you have teachers working their ass off, helping each student at the rise of a hand.

So normally school only costs tax payers. You get all the help you need for free, during class. You can fuck up all you want.

College, you pay a FUCKLOAD of $$$ for, get shitty teachers, have to do everything yourself, and have a low chance of success.

In america, College is Bullshit!

Divorce

The effects of divorce are extensive and cause a lot of conflict on families. Elliot Rodger dealt with family divorce. Same with adam lanza. And btw 80% of divorces are initiated by women. They don't marry for love, they just marry for alimony and taking all our stuff. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA so much for feminism.

"Women have always had it easy. Us men cannot have any emotion, we have to be into sports and killing, and we have to be strong. Women are only expected to use up our resources and -- in a distant past, take care of the family unit. 

Modern women, however, don't raise their kids. I know my little brother's best friend lived in a household with a single mother. She was 250+ pounds, made him do all of the chores and cleaning, and ignored the two youngest children. Those kids have spent most of their time playing video games instead of being taught values and morality. They will not have anything to reflect back on when they are older, and it is likely they will grow up weaker physically and mentally than would be.

That single mother? She married a jock football player at age 17, only to divorce him 8 years later and stunt the family. 50$ says she probably had some nice guy friends who she neglected or treated like shit. If she married one of the nerds / nice guys, I'd guarantee the entire family would be better off.

Women ignore and bully nice guys, and leave them to be rather miserable and rejected for their lifetime. The intellectuals and benevolent people usually never get laid and get bullied well into adulthood. It doesn't really change after high school. Yet retards, gearheads, and douchebags get rewarded for their idiocies.

This is evidence enough that women are stupid. Dish in the constant nagging, golddigging, manipulating, hypersexuality, cheating and so many other aspects of the typical 'liberated' woman, and anyone who doesn't have their head in their ass will agree that civilization has a major moral crisis going on.

#3. I have no friends here. All my friends are digital now, only time in life that I had a social life were the times I didnt live in the four corners. I tried a lot during my childhood in this area. But let me just put it this way- one of my friends and their little brothers and sisters, stealthily stole my Playstation 1 I had since the 90s, along with dozens of games - all which could be worth thousands of dollars nowadays. 

During high school, the other borrowed my N64 and games over the summer, promising to return them once school started again, and guess what the jackass did? He sold it to a guy in denver for $200. Didn't even give me any of the dough. Then threatened to kick my ass when I defended myself from some hicks. 

The others talked crap behind my back.. There was a time though around 4/20/12 when I got high with a few people out in the hills. One of the kids lived a few houses down and when I dropped out didn't even stop over to say hello. 

I may not seem the type, but I've been somewhat outgoing, friendly, a joker. I wasn't that kid who actively avoided people all the time and dressed in all black and listened to goth music. I went in, did my damned work, made straight A's then went home to a crap abusive family and did more work and surfed the net. 

My point? I tried to socialize in this shit town but to no avail. 

4. Major Depression, large amounts of anger and hatred, lots of boredom.. I used to cure it through bong hits and video games but I cant even find those enjoyable anymore. 

My dad's a fat lazy idiot who watches fox news all day, weighs 350 pounds and throws hissy fits over everything. Never even bothered to help me get my drivers license and I'm not entitled or spoiled or anything, I'd gladly get a job and pay for my own car. 

My moms a psycho hillbilly drunk from florida who's really mentally ill. She smokes and drinks a lot and smells disgusting, and has no manners whatsoever. The most hillbilly accent you can imagine. 

My bro is an antisocial douche with no education at 27. He's a user, always manipulating people and draining their resources. He moved back in to this crap house with his wife who bored 2 kids from some other guy, ex-meth, no education either. 

I got literally 0 contacts and I'm too lazy to get a GED.

Look, I'm sorry if I'm rude and hateful or anything, but I don't know what to do. I've lived no life for nearly 19 years, most of which was in the miserable ass sun-belt. Did you know new mexico has the fourth highest suicide rate?

I don't know if I'm even gonna get an education. I don't want to sound dumb but going into the wild is another option, but I'm thinking of getting a truck with those roofed installations on the back, then putting a bed in there and driving out of new mexico. the DMV is being whiny and asking for a proof of bank account and proof of rent or something; they're one of the worst DMVs out there and that's saying something, eh?

I am the only atheist I know in my town, and I've had knives pulled on me over it. If I do drift, I need a gun, a water purifier, medkit and some MREs. I've been thinking of driving to either the Denver area, San Jose, CA, Oregon, Washington, or Maine. I'd love to become a Canadian resident, but I gotta get a GED, get accepted into a 4 year college before I have
any chances. It'd be nearing the 2020s before that.

Every day I wake up filled with misery, boredom and hatred. In fact, I spent most of the2010s only on youtube, barely any forums, or in school where I was pretty miserable. I do get out of the house every day, where I take 2~4 hour walks to shed off some pounds and build stamina.

Here's my area. I dont like giving out personal info too much but I just want to prove mypoint. I live in the heart of the southwest, with no cities for like 200 miles in any direction.This causes an effect where the area I'm in is extremely rural. With the mormon influenceof utah, it also makes it really republican, like 80%. Everyone does meth, tobacco like crazy, lots of alcohol etc. AHS had a graduation rate of like 50%.

"Well IRL on my 13th birthday back in belen I had some good friends over, we were playing some XBOX and wii and shit then we were going on about ghosts stories and my friend derek talked about this creepy mask demon that stalked his dreams.. then the eletricity was screwing up and there was a much more eerie presence then I saw this fucking masked demon in the top-corner of the den. 

After then I always had a fear of corners and saw that mask sometimes but always had dreams about it. I remember one of my nightmares had it trap me through all the video games I played except it would corrupt and distort them. So I was playing OOT and saw that dante ghost suddenly attack me, where all 20 of my hearts quickly drained, at 2 hearts / second and I felt a really cold chill. Woke up and saw a bunch of mist across the room or something.

Culturally sure it's more accepting but as cheesy as the 90s was, I'd prefer it over - HoneyBoo Boo, Miley Cyrus, JB, One Direction, all this garbage bubblegum pop music, school shootings every week, a congress with 8% approval, 2 quagmire wars noone wants, etc

"Well generation Z (late 90s~10s) births grew up with a developed internet. They were often babied and spent most of their lives with the internet. With millenials they were 'special', somewhat grew up with a primitive internet of the 90s and early 00s, where it wasn't that much about socialization. 

Everything is all white and high-def, dumbed down; there's not much spirit to anything anymore. Marilyn manson used to be extremely offensive to a lot of people but now nobody cares except some idiot right-wingers from rural areas still stuck in the 1950s. 

I don't want to be insulting even more, but it's the parent's faults, for they are the ones to raise them. A lot of the parents are immature and careless themselves. You see this all the time where little girls are dressed in miniskirts and slut clothing with neon pink. It is an absolute disgrace. 

Lots of kids are savages. Remember south park's episode about how gingers had no souls? Well now all the kids will fucking tear red haired people apart for something extremely insignificant. I remember going to the mall with my older bro and overhearing some stupid teenagers talking about that one 'friday' music video - and how they enjoyed it. 

I'm not saying all Gen-zers are stupid spoiled brats; not all millenials are entitled and think they're better than everyone. And not all GG's are stuck in the past and want to kill all arabs and 'japs'. 

But a lot of them are like it! We're living in the best time in human history; clean food, vaccines, technology. But yet, people are becoming antisocial douchebags. Why can't we be excellent to eachother and unite as a society? It's not like we're gonna be living like kings forever, we're probably gonna fuck up the planet and cause ww3, or become a emotionless, robotic society void of any spirit, with .1% of people ruling every single aspects of our lives. 1984-esque","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

Redneck/Roughnecks. They're the stereotypical hillbillies you can find all over america; you either love sports and obsess over them or they'll collectively beat you up. Out here in the heart of the southwest, I deal with a unique type of hillbilly- one that has adapted to the harsh, inhospitable desert. At least the south has forests, ocean, beaches and swamps.. 

This town is 200 miles away from any city; it's right in the middle of nowhere and culturally, it's still stuck in the 1950s. Gays, Minorities, atheists.. they'd get lynched. In fact they actually lynched a transgender navajo a decade back. The place is pretty much 99% mormon, 80% conservative/republican, everyone does meth or tobacco, they're rednecks to the extreme!

So I'll just post offensive shit on the net instead. 

In all honestly, I think they need to legalize prostitution. Give these virgins in the gaming industry some escorts instead of ugly fat feminists. The escorts are sexually experienced. The feminists have a good chance to be.. not only inexperienced, but to cut your chode off. They'd also yell at you constantly.

"Another documentary to archive. I'll definitely check it out! 

Aight now I'm done with all those posts so let me move back to discussing Jeff Weise. I don't give a fuck about the new stigma of giving attention to killers, as it's going to happen anyways. Let me just say I bet green money Jeff knew if he just killed himself he wouldn't be remembered by more than like a dozen people. All who gave him shit wouldn't care and would laugh at him anyways and think of him as weak. You cannot hope for any decency from a bunch of scumbags who lack any form of empathy anyways. Mass murderers kill for fame. 

I know its a bit out of place to write a TL;DR piece about jeff on another article, but whatever. If you look at the area where he lived, it's on a native american reservation. I live near the largest one in the US, the navajo nation. There's a huge crime rate there, with extreme homicide/suicide rates, and everyone is dirt poor. It's a fucking 3rd world country in the middle of fucking nowhere (arizona). Now imagine instead of a desert wasteland, a cold, (even more) isolated place far from a city. 

Imagine all the pain 'regret' went through. His parents dying, having only his grandparents to depend on, in the middle of nowhere back before the internet became super-social. Of course when he went postal it did get 15 minutes of fame, but nobody knows who he is... because he isn't some suburban white boy. There's a bias on other races. 

Come next march, it will be 10 years since his death! That's an entire decade that's passed.

If ghosts exist, that means the bloke had to deal with a decade of extra misery, now possibly tormented by 8 victims. 

As for the kid who went postal today, he only killed like 3 so it's not sufficient enough to become a household name. Since he's white if he just dished in 6 more souls the circus would be in full swing...","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

"You might not wanna admit it, but those 2 fuckers had style. Most of these events has some pissed off depressed kid go and kill like 2~3 people. Some who are actually competent, like lanza or cho, kill dozens, but leave behind nothing but incoherent ramblings. The columbine weirdos did their act right around the turn of the millenium, in a suburban culture-war area, filled with uptight soccermom cunts, and had carefully manipulated everyone and everything into order. They carried lots of knives, and 99 bombs. If their propane bombs detonated, there'd be 450+ deaths from the blasts alone. 

They also left behind journals, videos, etc. Plus the police report was like 20,000 pages long. Waco made a dent in the american morale, mcveigh left a bigger one. Columbine ruined school even further, and issued in a huge ass moral panic. A generation later, columbine is still a household name, and nobody remembers that word for the beautiful flower you can find in colorado, but for that event that happened a fuckin decade and'a' half ago. 

tl;dr all these kids know about it even though they were like toddlers back then, because it's still very famous today.

"Take, for instance, when I lived in a town about 30 miles south of Albuqerque. It had massive crime, serial killers, drug cartels-men, etc. They even fired all of the police force back in 2009. The town was about 80% Hispanic, and most of the whites were old ww2 vets, so growing up there, I was a minority in school. I'm not going to tl;dr post but to sum up, a lot of the students treated me like a second-class citizen. 

There were about 5 major families which most people belonged to. If you got in a fight with a Chavez, you could guarantee you'd make 200+ enemies, who have access to guns. The police were often incompetent and corrupt, even before the crisis.. 

The staff in the schools, being part of the big 5, often were extremely corrupt themselves. They also singled me out all the time because I was very unpopular (being non-religious in a 90% catholic town), along with being the computer nerd, when most of the students were in poverty.. 

For instance, back in 07 one of my best friends, Aaron was this short, akward African American bloke. One of the ghetto scumbags punched him in the nose, causing severe bleeding. It took 6 minutes for staff to get the situation addressed. The douchebag who broke his nose, he only got 3 days suspension, when he should've been sent to jail. 

Caucasians have our history of racism, and it's still alive in the south lol, but everywhere else it's not much of a problem at all anymore. Plus you got liberals who white knight minorities like crazy. 

Anyways, hate crime policies serve to protect minorities, but I bet you green money if I got socked by a ghetto thug from Los lunas noone would be defending or standing up for me.

"I strongly suggest using .22's for hobbyists / beginners, for obvious reasons. Get a .22 rifle for around $150-200 in america.

Since mass murder is common now in america, a lot of people usually buy up as much ammo as they can, leading to shortages and price hikes, so take notice of these events and plan your wallet accordingly. 

22 lr isn't very expensive, and is very great for target practice. If you need to defend yourself, it is still quite capable of being fatal, but learn a mozambique drill. 

If you just want a light-weight / agile / small self defense weapon, save up $500 for a .45 glock or something..

He always followed my brother around and tried to cheer him up when he was going through his depression and anger. After 2006, Piggy started to do the same for me.

I could go on for weeks about how corrupt and worthless most of the education system is for most people, but 90% of us probably had firsthand experience with the typical american school. 

Tradition will always rule. Hard physical labour is always going to be the core foundation for a civilization. These office jobs were a dream back in 50's america and all that, but now they're mostly shitty jobs.

I hate my town but all these oil workers are getting 40,000 a year in the first year of their 'career' in the oil fields. most americans on average only make HALF of that. 

If you waste all that scholarship / middle/rich class parent's dough on a faggy little liberal arts degeree, you deserve to work minimum wage through your 20s. 

STEM and Strength leads the way. 
Womens studies & art is only gay. 

GET CERTIFIED. If you have a high school diploma, you AREN'T fucked. High school dropouts can't get 90% of the jobs. Stay in school and deal with the bullshit, the bullies, degenerates, just toughen up. Don't listen to the liberal agenda of being a pussy. If anyone gives you shit, beat the shit out of them. 

Social skills is 70% of what will make you succeed. 

DON'T take the easy way out, for it'll be the hardest in the end. Work your ass off, get a stem field, graduate from university there and make a 6 digit figure. 

and hell if you don't feel like going that far, get certified in welding, trucking, plumbing or electronics. You'll make anywhere from $30~60,000 a year. WORK for the oil fields if you can.

"Violent media usually prevents real life violence and I can easily be generic and pull this
little chart out to prove it.

Like I said earlier, a newly 13 yr old kid from my town downright killed himself. He had a upper-middle class family (200,000 / yr ) .. which confuses me as to why they would move to this ugly, redneck rundown desert shithole of a town.. Anyways, he fucking kills himself from all the bullshit from the town. 

I usually take daily walks, ever since 2014 when I stopped being as much as a shutin. I casually talk to a few people here and there. I remember having a few lengthy conversations with folks, and when it was relevant to the subject being discussed, I probably brought up the story of the kid a few times. 

You know what they all said about that kid? He was a sinner and deserved it. Those arent my words, they're the words of the redneck shitheads here. They're all mormon psychopaths addicted to tobacco and meth driving shitty pickup trucks from the 70s. 

You know the movie naoplean dynamtie? Imagine that but with 50x more hostility in the rednecks, and all the scenery replaced by ugly light-tan wasteland covered with weeds everywhere. 

My point? you cant blame that kid for killing himself. I'm not supporting his decision, because most suicidal people are usually good people at heart. Most victims of suicide ARE NOT REMEMBERED. I've spoken to the parents of this child and inspired them to do what the parents of Ryan Halligan did and perhaps make a memorial site and do public speaking on behalf of the bloke. 

Now with that being said, the bloke still had great parents and a nice house, but it's not like that would really counter the fact that the people we're surrounded with are thrice as scary as southerners. 

Weise lived far away from a lot of american civilization in a fucking rez. You all know his life story by now so it should be of no surprise why he was so dark and disturbed. 

To wrap this tl;dr post up.. The reason why most modern mass murderers exist is because they know for a fact that suicide alone would just leave them forgotten forever. But if they pull the trigger and take out some random people with them, the media will make them the talk of (not only the town) but the nation and perhaps even the world. 

Red Lake was on-par with columbine, and yet only got 1% as much attention. You know why? Because they were all native americans- minorities. Even still, a lot of people still faintly remember it 10 years later. Imagine if weise never went postal. Maybe a dozen would've known about it enough to turn a glance his way for a moment, maybe his grandpa would care. 

It's the killer's fault for the tragedy, but society's fault for making the killers. 

As for anyone thinking violent video games cause real life violence..","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"
"Thanks for a decent nonbiased post that actually contributed to the thread bro.

Like I usually say, for this specific case (Red Lake) it's hard not to feel incredibly sorry for the bloke. Given his life circumstances, very few would've overcome those challenges and horrible experiences to become a normal person.

If I had a decent family, great genetics and didnt live in a desert shithole state, I would've had a future and a positive outlook on life too. Even small changes like a different location around here would've had massive effects on my psyche.

When that guy had his dad kill himself, a drunk abusive shithead for a mom (Who became disabled for life due to a car crash) and was forced to move to a indian reservation you cant blame him for being violent and suicidal.

Like I said, I live near the largest native rez in the country. Even 20 miles from the border in a small quiet town, there's still lots of corruption, suicidal people (a 13 year old boy killed himself a while ago) and no real jobs. We're mostly white, if that says anything. Even generic american whites are living in 3rd world conditions out here.

I'm not going to troll or be evil. Mass murder is inexcusable and absolutely never commendable.

American and most western civilization isnt even really civil. You're on your own out here. Few friends will back you up, most people's families are close-minded and horrible, and we're no longer the great country we say we are, we're 2nd-class compared to much of western europe. Unless you're making 250,000$ / yr as a family unit, you are no longer
the fabled middle class of the 20th century.

Lots of people say they help the depressed /suicidal, but very few seek to help them. Hell, depression isnt constant sadness, at least once you hit adulthood. If weise stayed alive another 5 years before commiting suicide he would've gone absolutely insane. Once you're done with school, life goes from easy mode to insane mode.","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

Since this will be the first entry in this livejournal, I feel it important to include some sort of introduction. My name is.. well, I'd rather not leave my personal details public on the internet. Although it is just about 2016, and LJ's heyday is a decade old, I feel Livejournal efficient enough for my goal of creating a virtual journal. I am undergoing this project in the slight chance that I may perish. I would rather not be completely forgotten; I'd rather leave some digital footprints for my family and friends and any lurkers. I do not suggest that I'm likely to die anytime soon, considering the fact that I am barely in my 20s. This project will allow me to exercise my brand-new keyboard (AULA model on sale for $22, original price was $50,) and my writing capabilities. It will also be nice to look back on this journal when I am an older adult. Since it isn't being written on paper, I will be able to recover the data for as long as this site is up. I won't accidentally spill some juice on the note and render it unreadable, or tear it up and throw it away; you understand the point I make. 

Now then, an entry.. 

Today's work
I usually keep a schedule on a notepad in real life where I document each day's tasks and
chores, so I'll emulate it here;
1. Encyclopedia Dramatica; I worked on a few of my own pages along with a half dozen
other ones
2. I continued to archive various documents relating to my research and interests
3. I used my alts to upvote my content (see: whiteknighting) on a specific gaming website
4. I did a moderate amount of exercise
5. I cleaned out my grandfather's WW2 military storage unit and reorganized the
materials within
6. I cleaned my room, paying close attention to every square inch of material to clean
7. I successfully stayed up 24 hours to shift myself back to a day-schedule
8. Did a bunch of chores
9. Cleaned up my desktop, deleted bad games / media to clear up space. Notably, I
uninstalled GMOD but discovered the addons and downloads were still there. After
deleting them, I freed up 28 GB of space
10. I archived some of my media...
And most importantly..
11. I made this livejournal account!

 Notable Events I've finally been able to get insurance that allows me to be able to afford dental appointments. My dental situation is equivalent to that of a pollack, and I need to get my four wisdom teeth extracted on the 22nd. I hope this doctor doesn't fuck this up and permanently damage my nerves or jaw. 

What I have to sayNothing much for now. Time is like a river... When you're born it goes slowly yet you don't even comprehend it; when you are finally able to see it when you're a young child, it flows slowly and peacefully. When you're on the verge of adolescence, it begins to pick up pace and it quickly becomes difficult to keep track of the rippling in the water. When you hit an adult age (around 16), you'll find it going at a dozen times the speed that it went by as a child. Eventually, it becomes impossible to keep track of the details. 

Just how much time has passed? The last time I was truly happy with existence.. 2008;

 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 .. 7 fucking years. 

My live has been a poor quality existence for the last 7 years. I have little faith my situation is going to get better. The economy will probably never recover from the great recession. The only people who will become president in the 2016 elections are Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Hillary, or another Bush. Suffice to say, I have no faith whatsoever in my nation anymore.

I presume similar numbers for mass shooters as well. 

Blame them for their own actions, but why is bullying / harassment barely ever tackled? Why is the help for mental illness so nil?

"It has been a while since my last entry.. Today I'll cover the following subjects; Time, Corruption, Life and Death. These are probably going to be the most recurring subject matter if I continue to blog.. 

Firstly, it's been a very long time now. I remember 2007~09 like it was yesterday, and yet I'm starting to lose much of my memory of that time period. Let's take a look at how much time has passed; 

2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015. So 11 entire years have passed that I've lived in this state. More than half of my life has been spent in one of the worst states in the entire country, and the USA is one of the largest nations in the world. When you look at the list of years, 2005 is barely that far apart from 07, and yet 05 and 06 were probably the worst years I've went through. In less than a year now, I'll begin to experience life a decade in the future from my heyday. A decade, in seemingly the blink of an eye. It's crazy. 

Hell, as I type this, it's already been 4 years since I've left school. Mass Effect 3 is almost 4 years old already! Skyrim is already at that point. Oblivion is going to be 10 YEARS OLD in a few months. Xbox 360's already hit that point. 

My grandfather died over 10 years ago.. My loyal companion, a fat, muscular golden cat named Piggy has been 6ft under for 4 1/2 years now as well. Crazy.. 

Now.. looking into the future, I see no hope. The middle class continues to die, more americans go on welfare or poverty, the rich grow in power, suicide and mass murder skyrockets, USA loses it's power, etc. My predictions aren't even hypothetical; they're already happening and have been for decades. 

Society has also been corrupted and decayed. Nowadays it's not even uncommon for frikin Pre-teens to lose their v-cards. It's disgusting. Most males are backstabbing betas, or alpha assholes. It's rare to find a good friend nowadays. You have a 50% chance of being divorced within like 5 years at this point by an american bride. The courts are 90% in her favor for most shit as well. 

Look at the military. PC now. You're more likely to commit suicide than to be KIA. You get treated like fucking garbage by the country you stepped up to 'defend'. It's a fucking shithole in america now, but you don't see europeans accepting any american refugees or migrants. Instead these assclowns let in hordes of rapists and murderers. White civilization is cucked and fucked. The world is hence, not even worth living in anymore.

"Little braids like horns,
this flesh born bone leaves sores.
Little horn is born, sworn to the blood
in all that implies after being on the frontlines
of the hidden genocide;
Time to turn the tide,
take the guize of a genocidal genius.

Feels like none of the people can see this.
Depletion with depletion,
seeking the solution,
but there are no easy answers,
for this classroom execution.
Born on a plane that is not the same as their mind,
I am the weak, the sick, the one left behind.
God damnit I'm sick of their kind!
Pieces of shit don't even know what they are;
in their little cliques, laughing and smiling with their friends,
passing judgement on everything they seeI know they're laughing at me.

I am an angel in disguise,
sent to either be nurtured or denied.
I am an angel that fide, so as punished with this life.
My feathers have not changed,
I still blame god for making me this way.
That is my nature, the true test was for you
to nurture a soul you could see needed structure.
For all of your talk of tradition, you never taught acceptance;
of the benefits of being receptive.
Instead, you took my beauty as a commonality,
of a word you didn't hesitate to call me.
Reinforcing old war wounds, you made me legion.

Here to bring your ruin, and the changing of reason.
Trapped in this physical body, I can only see one way to be free.
I will change this fucked up world, by making sure everyone knows of me...

"Current Location:Liberty City 
Current Mood:depressed depressed 
Current Music:Soviet Connection 

Already 40 days into this year, and I doubt it's going to get any better. I've been dealing with a moderate sickness which has caused me to miss a dentist appointment. My front teeth are starting to cause me severe pain when pressure or liquid makes contact which shouldn't even be happening as the dentists did 2 hours of work on them a few weeks ago. I just got 3 cavities left to patch up and my teeth will be alright, but enough about this shit. 

For the last few weeks, I've been playing the f*** out of Grand Theft Auto IV. It's just about 8 years old now, but I'm still finding new things every time I play. I must confess that despite now owning GTA 5 (due to a friend gifting me it on steam), I've never beat it. Up until I was gifted it, I never even touched the game. Despite the fact that 5 is superior to 4 in most ways, I still find more enjoyment in GTA 4; 280+ hours of it to be precise. Suffice to say, I'm addicted to Liberty City, and all the fucked up freaks and events that take place within this virtual world. 

Through the near-decade long time I've spent on IV, I mostly frequented the southern half of the eastern borough, and downtown 'manhatten' and the central park. Lately, I've been exploring the smaller obscure islands and finding a lot of shit. I modded some health / armor regen scripts to make the game a hell of a lot less tedius, but practically doubled the damage of the weapons and vastly expanded the range of them; the sawed off shotgun is capable of downing someone over 200m from you (although it is VERY unlikely due to the spread)

I've been going on GTA 4's internet and browsing these sites. I've found shit I never read before. GTA 4 is on par with TES 4 on the amount of shit you can still discover. I was reading blogs in game and legit threw up from one of them. It was basically some ugly fat feminist furfag cunt talking about her perverted sexual activity with someone else and dousing each other with dishwasher liquids. I'm just sitting here thinking.. Someone employed at Rockstar North is even more fucked up in the head than I am. My writing shifts more towards patrick bateman / ER shit. This rockstar jackass is just a perverted troll with a way-overactive imagination. Fucker should see a shrink. 

Well, 2007 is already 8~9 years old. It's scary to me how time just flew by. I always bitch about how my future is bleak, and indeed the entire nation and world's is (unless you're a spoiled fucking cunt, in which case check your privileged for real, asshole) but I know I'm not the only one thinking this shit. Obama's got less than a year left in office now. GTA 5 is already 2 years old man.. fucking hell. 

Those days as a kid in that ALB Metro house, with the two fireplaces, the large den; the cozy old-school feel.. It's not even close to recent anymore. All this time I've spent as a shut-in / NEET / outcast.. I remember a time before social media and smartphones. Chad and Chloe weren't entirely fucking brainless zombies addicted to their screens. They're still normies though, so they're still absolute scum of the earth who deserve nothing but a few stabs into their jugular vein. What I'm trying to show you is, the world's a different place than it was when I was growing up. We're seeing Global warming finally having some serious effects. We got the USA at the quality of a 3rd world country now, with a middle class minority, severe poverty, accelerating crime and corruption and the greatest security state in the world's history on the horizon. Just for typing in these buzzwords, I'm now on a couple more watchlists, and nobody is going to be reading this shit anyways except you NSA ass clowns. 

Here's something to rustle your jimmies. If I was to reenact the shit I've been doing in GTA 4, in the real world, I'd probably have a 7-fuckin' star wanted level. I've been going around driving over thousands of NPCs in central park over and over for shits and giggles, acting out an ""anders"" dozens of times, beating the shit out of random fuckers and other shenanigans. 

Not much else I feel I should type out anyways. It's already TL;DR but perhaps one of the JIDF rats or creepy faggots from my past might be lurking around. In which case.. I hope you enjoy this entry you crazy ass motherfuckers.","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

When I did, guess what? There were actually other people playing! It was none other than my dear friend RanGun. Ran and I go back a decade.

"It's been around two months since my last entry. As usual, time is fucking flying, societal deterioration accelerating, and the collective IQ of the american collective declining.

I will not give exact details, but a mindfuck IRL happened. I quickly JIDF'd a lot of my troll dust, and have been going incognito a lot more. 

My childhood game was briefly revived for a little bit again; I brought in my longtime friends to play it again, and some kids from the newer version of it checked on the original. In total, probably 10 people went through my server. I directed a few projects; recreations of Venice, a Medieval-oriented map, an underwater city (not worked on), along with other projects. This was a game that was pretty much abandoned (Besides a small group of people) since 2008, revived with some activity after nearly a decade of rot. I feel blessed to have experienced some fresh memories of the game. 

I'm considering maybe making a blog about the game but I know for a fact nobody would visit it. Hell, I know for the most part I'm talking to myself on this ""blog"" here, but oh well. 

I'm not trying to talk to myself; I'm trying to document my experiences, and to give some words of wisdom to you. 

I've been neglecting some of my most important work, so I need to knock some sense in myself. I've done plenty of internet archiving for now, and I've cleaned up one of my more favourite sites, even if some of the mods and admins on it are autistic cunts. But, nowhere online is safe from these kinds of people.

"It's been about a month since the last entry, save 3 days. I'm currently cooking up some dinner while I type this but noone gives a damn. A lot has happened in this month, so far... 

One of my good friends, whom I've barely known for less than a year, yet has risen to be one of my bros, challenged me to a debate. He is of a religion I won't specify (it's not islam, dont worry) but was challenging my lack of faith in any paranormal / spiritual shit. So he told me to do a mental ritual. I did, and I asked for what I want (Success with my endeavors, and meeting girls). I had a 10/10 luck streak that lasted a week. In that time... 

5 of the ladies I knew, sent me nudes (each one of them) and got comfortable sexting with me. 

One young woman I know IRL, will be visiting me after this semester's out, and will be making my life the best it's been since 2008. 

I became an admin of a very notable site. 

After thinking about a specific reservation and the tragedy that befell them (early in may, a similar tragedy effected the rez Im from), I found some random Native American dude on omegle. I went on there to troll but instead had a good conversation with this dude. He talked to me about how 6 of his friends chose to end it. He is from the poorest rez in america yet made it to college. Kudos to him.

I talked to a very famous dude (hint: 2011, retaliation against some faggy little bully) for 40 minutes. I went on to skype some chick but she went to bed; instead, the famous dude was on for once. He allowed people to add him on skype, so I did; I thought it was an impostor but it was actually him. I brought up the dude I met yesterday, and the famous dude told me how he talked 13 people out of becoming an hero. Good job man.

I made one of the girls I know into a sort of girlfriend, the first time I had one since 2009.

The luck wore out after a week but I still pray to the specific 'subjects' that I did when I did the meditation-focus experiment. 666","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

"Most of the ""leaders"" of the alt right are directly connected to jews in some way.

Richard Spencer posed with jews and attended some synagogues or other congregations of the jews before and is likely a CIA plant as previously suggested here.

Alex Jones (who is barely alt-right but the ZOG media will claim he is) legit admits to
being a juden:

Milo is of course jewish.

Andrew Anglin of the Daily Stormer contracted someone (who's cool as fuck) of the jewish ethnicity to help significantly with building elements of his website, which is most likely an unwitting infiltrated fbi honeypot by now like Stormfront is.

David Duke seems cool but I wouldn't be surprised if even he is kosher.

The alt-light is equivalent to reddit fags compared to dedicated 8ch pol posters, but is still superior to neocons and most conservatives. The real alt-right meme is just a rehash of the concept of Anonymous. Autists trying to claim they own that movement are the reason why it's probably going to come crashing down in a few years; think Op-Chanology
2.0. The Alt-right is way better than (((neocon))) boomer fucks or neoliberal twats though.

A significant fuel source for infighting within the alt-right (as seen especially on Daily Stormer and /pol/) is on the issue of women. I'd say on average 15~35% of the communities to be white knights who put pussy on a pedestal. However, one of the major ideas kicking off on DS is the idea of White Sharia; of severely oppressing thots and restricting women's rights. This caused a clear divide in the community with the WKs having to bow to the will of the majority and the thots in the audience making assclowns of themselves before getting sent to the kitchen. Most alt-right communities, although
mostly similar, seem to hate other communities guts. /pol/ will talk shit about Daily Stormer, which will talk shit about Stormfront, etc in a continuing cycle.

Feds usually try to trick aggressive twats into agreeing to acts or conspiracy of violence, but I think all those clowns should do is to further fuel that divide to fuck the movement up, something most alt-righters are doing to a small extent already. Regarding the issues of the migrant crisis, kikery, feminazism, etc, the Alt-Right will definitely survive for at least half a decade. It's not guaranteed to be the 4th Reich as of now, until another civil war or civilizational collapse occurs. Granted that trolls boosted Trump into office, anything is definitely possible.","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

"human race has not only betrayed its ancestors, but the future generations too. Homo Sapiens, HAH! It is more like a Homo Idioticus to me! When I look at people I see every day in society, school and everywhere... I can’t say I belong to same race as the lousy, miserable, arrogant, selfish human race! No! I have evolved one step above! Naturality has been discriminated through religions, ideologies, laws and other mass delusion systems. Individual, who is going through his/hers natural power process and trying to live naturally, but is being told that the way he acts or thinks is wrong and stupid, will usually have some reactions which might be considered as ""psychological disorders"" by the establishment. In reality they are just natural reactions to the disruption of natural power process. They will have some of the following (depending on individual's personality): feelings of inferiority / superiority, hostility, aggression, frustration, depression, self-hatred / hatred towards other people, suicidal / homicidal thought etc... and it is completely normal. Humans are just a species among other animals and world does not exist only for humans. Death and killing is not a tragedy, it happens in nature all the time between all species. Not all human lives are important or worth saving. Only superior (intelligent, self-aware, strong-minded) individuals should survive while inferior (stupid, retarded, weak-minded masses) should perish. There is also another solution to the problem: stupid people as slaves and intelligent people as free. What I mean is that they who have free minds, are capable of intelligent existential and philosophical thinking and know what justice is, should be free and rulers... and the robotic masses, they can be slaves since they do not mind it now either and because their minds are on so retarded level. The gangsters that now rule societies, would of course get what they deserve. Of course there is a final solution too: death of entire human race. It would solve every problem of humanity. The faster human race is wiped out from this planet, the better... no one should be left alive. I have no mercy for the scum of earth, the pathetic human race. Collective Deindividualization: Totalitarianism & Delusions Of Democracy Collective deindividualization is a phenomenon where individual will be trained as part of the mindless herd controlled by state, corporation, church or some other organization, group, ideology, religion or mass delusion system and adopt it's rules, morality and codes of conduct. This phenomenon has been familiar in all despotic, authoritarian, totalitarian, monarchist, communist, socialist, nazi, fascist and religious societies troughout history. Also, the modern western democratic republics have the same phenomenon. It is just done so that people will think they are free and don't realize they are being enslaved. Majority of people in society are weak-minded and ignorant retards, masses that act like programmed robots and accept voluntarily slavery. But not me! I am self-aware and realize what is going on in society! I have a free mind! And I choose to be free rather than live like a robot or slave. You can say I have a “god complex”, sure... then you have a “group complex”! Compared to you retarded masses, I am actually godlike. Totalitarian governments rule people through education system, consumerism, mass media, monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force (police, military) and laws discriminating people who think differently than the majority. Democracy... you think democracy means freedom and justice? You are wrong. Democracy is a dictatorship of the moral majority... and the majority is manipulated and ruled by the state mafia. Modern western democracy has nothing to do with freedom or justice; it is totalitarian and corrupted system. Laws are made over the heads of the people and people are being brainwashed to support the system and connected to the institutional structures immediately after their birth. Societies are being ruled by manipulative and charismatic politicians who only care about the interests of majority, and who do not base their decisions on reason but emotions and feelings of the masses. These masses let the authorities of state to make all the important decisions for them. The masses will get an education, they study, get a job, go to work and vote in elections. They think they are free and don’t criticise or question the system. They have become robots. It is like a constructed mechanism in mind, that leaves little choice for an individual to think, talk and act independently. Three Kinds Of Humans There are three kinds of human personality types in this world: 1) individualistic human (3% of the world population) 2) manipulative human (3% of the world population) 3) mass human (94% of the world population) #1 & #2 type of personalities are intelligent, creative and self-aware. They have chosen bit different paths paths. #3 type of personalities are less intelligent and less creative, weak-minded people controlled by #2 type of personalities. The percentages are only estimations though but are based on Gaussian distribution and history of human race and how humans have organized into societies. And this is the way it has always been ever since humans started to organize into communities. Another way how to divide people is bit different but is based on the same facts, human nature and history. The division is based on the level of intelligence and quality of mentality: 1) intelligent (3% of the world population) 2) slightly retarded, so called “normal people” or “robots” (94% of the world population) 3) highly retarded, “vegetables” (3% of the world population) Total War Against Humanity Hate, Im so full of it and I love it. That is one thing I really love. Some time ago, I used to believe in humanity and I wanted to live a long and happy life... but then I woke up. I started to think deeper and realized things. But it was not easy to become existential... knowing as much as I know has made me unhappy, frustrated and angry. I just can’t be happy in the society or the reality I live. Due to long process of existential thinking, observing the society I live and some other things happened in my life... I have come to the point where I feel nothing but hate against humanity and human race. Life is just a meaningless coincidence... result of long process of evolution and many several factors, causes and effects. However, life is also something that an individual wants and determines it to be. And I'm the dictator and god of my own life. And me, I have chosen my way. I am prepared to fight and die for my cause. I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection. You might ask yourselves, why did I do this and what do I want. Well, most of you are too arrogant and closed-minded to understand... You will proprably say me that I am “insane”, “crazy”, “psychopath”, “criminal” or crap like that. No, the truth is that I am just an animl, a human, an individual, a dissident. I have had enough. I don’t want to be part of this fucked up society. Like some other wise people have said in the past, human race is not worth fighting for or saving... only worth killing. But... When my enemies will run and hide in fear when mentioning my name... When the gangsters of the corrupted governments have been shot in the streets... When the rule of idioracy and the democratic system has been replaced with justice... When intelligent people are finally free and rule the society instead of the idiocratic rule of majority... In that great day of deliverance, you will know what I want. Long live the revolution... revolution against the system, which enslaves not only the majority of weak-minded masses but also the small minority of strong-minded and intelligent individuals! If we want to live in a different world, we must act. We must rise against the enslaving, corrupted and totalitarian regimes and overthrow the tyrants, gangsters and the rule of idiocracy. I can’t alone change much but hopefully my actions will inspire all the intelligent people of the world and start some sort of revolution against the current systems. The system discriminating naturality and justice, is my enemy. The people living in the world of delusion and supporting this system are my enemies. I am ready to die for a cause I know is right, just and true... even if I would lose or the battle would be only remembered as evil... I will rather fight and die than live a long and unhappy life. And remember that this is my war, my ideas and my plans. Don’t blame anyone else for my actions than myself. Don’t blame my parents or my friends. I told nobody about my plans and I always kept them inside my mind only. Don’t blame the movies I see, the music I hear, the games I play or the books I read. No, they had nothing to do with this. This is my war: one man war against humanity, governments and weak-minded masses of the world! No mercy for the scum of the earth! HUMANITY IS OVERRATED! It's time to put NATURAL SELECTION & SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST back on tracks! Justice renders to everyone his due. - Pekka-Eric Auvinen (aka NaturalSelector89, Natural Selector, Sturmgeist89 and Sturmgeist).

"One of Bonnie Parker's Poems -

THE TRAIL'S END 

You've read the story of Jesse James of how he lived and died. If you're still in need; of something to read, here's the story of Bonnie and Clyde. 

Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow gang I'm sure you all have read. how they rob and steal; and those who squeal, are usually found dying or dead. 

There's lots of untruths to these write-ups; they're not as ruthless as that. their nature is raw; they hate all the law, the stool pidgeons, spotters and rats. 

They call them cold-blooded killers they say they are heartless and mean. But I say this with pride that I once knew Clyde, when he was honest and upright and clean. 

But the law fooled around; kept taking him down, and locking him up in a cell. Till he said to me; ""I'll never be free, so I'll meet a few of them in hell"" 

The road was so dimly lighted there were no highway signs to guide. But they made up their minds; if all roads were blind, they wouldn't give up till they died. 

The road gets dimmer and dimmer sometimes you can hardly see. But it's fight man to man and do all you can, for they know they can never be free. 

From heart-break some people have suffered from weariness some people have died. But take it all in all; our troubles are small, till we get like Bonnie and Clyde. 

If a policeman is killed in Dallas and they have no clue or guide. If they can't find a fiend, they just wipe their slate clean and hang it on Bonnie and Clyde. 

There's two crimes committed in America not accredited to the Barrow mob. They had no hand; in the kidnap demand, nor the Kansas City Depot job. 

A newsboy once said to his buddy; ""I wish old Clyde would get jumped. In these awfull hard times; we'd make a few dimes, if five or six cops would get bumped"" 

The police haven't got the report yet but Clyde called me up today. He said,""Don't start any fights; we aren't working nights, we're joining the NRA."" 

From Irving to West Dallas viaduct is known as the Great Divide. Where the women are kin; and the men are men, and they won't ""stool"" on Bonnie and Clyde. 

If they try to act like citizens and rent them a nice little flat. About the third night; they're invited to fight, by a sub-gun's rat-tat-tat.

They don't think they're too smart or desperate they know that the law always wins. They've been shot at before; but they do not ignore, that death is the wages of sin. 

Some day they'll go down together they'll bury them side by side. To few it'll be grief, to the law a relief but it's death for Bonnie and Clyde.

But it's fun. I just don't know how to go about getting someone, like a movie director or producer to look at it. Cuz' I've never been in this field of work before. But I don't need to worry about that just yet, cuz' I don't even know how it's gonna end. Like, I kinda know the final conclusion. But there's tons of extra stuff I can add or delete from the last 20 minutes of the movie. 

Like in the movie ""SAW 2"". The last 10 minutes or so, makes the movie great. And just like that, there's tons of movies where the last bits are spectacular, and only then is the movie a success.

A little blonde haired girl is walking home from school 

Then a soft drizzle (no wind) Tap tap tap it said, as the raindrops hit the pavement Tap tap tap it said, as it hit the roof tops Tap tap tap it said, as it hit the cars, trucks, and buses Tap tap tap it said. Again and again and again. 

The little girl looks up at the sky, giggles slightly to herself, and starts to walk faster 

The rain quickens it's pace (a strong breeze) Shhhhhhhhhh it said, as it splashed against the windows Shhhhhhhhhh it said, as it flooded the streets Shhhhhhhhhh it said, as it drowned the rodents and insects  Shhhhhhhhhh it said. Just....Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 

The little cutie smiles to herself as she starts running. Her greenish-blue eyes glimmer with excitment. 

The moderate rain turns to all out thundershowers, a likes of which has never been seen on this wretched earth. From the skies comes a laughter, a laugh like no other. 

The little girl runs home and opens the front door. She holds the wall for support as she takes of her shoes. She's so happy.  She runs up the stairs into her mothers arms A blood curling scream is heard.

Drapped in black cloth. Head to toe, all black Boots as black as tar Cloak lashing to and fro with the wind The hood covers his face entirely  The skeletal horse he rides neighs with ferosity as the reigns are pulled to the side to steer the mighty beast to the left.  His two-handed sword on his back, axe on his left side, sword on the right. A modified shotgun on a leather sling hangs downwards 

The mysterious figure rides down to the earth on what would appear to be an invisible mountain. As his steads hoofs touch the wet grass, it lets out an angry growl, almost as though it yearns to be elsewhere. 

The disgusting human creatures scream in panic and run in all directons, taking with them their lies and deceptions. The Death Knight gazes at the humans with an empty stare, as they knock each other down in a mad dash to safety. He wishes to slaughter them as they flee, but sensing that his war horse is hungry and quite weary of the long journey, he decides to rest.

I just wish the rain didn't pick up, otherwise it would'a been perfect. I see people running from the rain, it makes me laugh. You know, how people quickly rush from their car, or home, or shopping mall, so they don't get wet. I don't get it!  Or with their umbrellas (I don't use Umbrellas) 

My trenchcoat flew behind me a couple of times when the wind picked up, other than that not very windy. Just the way I like it. And it was deserted, every street, it looked like everyone had died. Cuz' there wasn't a person anywhere. Another reason i liked it. lol. Well, not no one on one. I did see some people, but like 95% less population than regular. 

Ever notice that when the clouds turn grey the humans become sparse, like, even before the rain, even if there is no rain. I'll never understand humans. The way they live their lives, their feelings, the things they want to do in life, probably has something to do with theseinvisible gods they pray to. Meh.

"Hip Hop isn't music it's inferior - Hip hop isn't music, it's just animals jumping up and down, like monkeys. Why don't the men respect the women, why are the men always calling the women ""bitches"" and ""hos""?, but more importantly, why do these women like to be talked to like this, and treated like this? 

Someone actually told me Snoop Doggy Dog is a poet. Can you believe that. A poet? You see...you see...people actually believe this. Animals...just animals. Have you seen some of their videos that play 24/7 on all the music channels worldwide? It's all image. all the girls are acting like whores, sorry, let me rephrase that...all the girls are whores. I can't understand what has happened to this world. 

They keep refering to each other as niggers or niggahs, they're all black, yet they keep saying the ""N"" word to each other? Does this mean that they understand that they are in fact inferior niggahs? They should stop, and be more gentlemanly and civilized. In one video some rapped is trying to have sex with a car, while eatting fried chicken. WTF!!! 

Things weren't like this before. People had respect for each other, they had manners, and a sense of decency.

"What's with.....? - What's with all the slow lines everywhere? At the dep, at the mall, at the S.A.A.Q., even though we need more people at the cash registers, they keep replacing people with machines....machines that suck, and malfunction. 

What's with the construction workers? Why do they get paid so much, to work so slow? The places i've worked, we have to work super fast for so little money. Am i in some sort of Bizzaro world, like i'm the only one in it. 

What's with all the bitches? It's almost as though there was some sort of bitch convention somewhere, and 85% of the women went and all agreed to be bitches forever. The other 15% were spared. But having all these bitches in one room gave them a great power. A power not yet seen in this world. It's a special attack move of theirs. It transforms them into super bitches. It's so powerful, that they can only remain in that state for a short period of time, then they go back to being ordinary bitches. 

What's with all the assholes? It's like they invited all the men to a huge arena, where all the sports were playing, Soccer, baseball, basketball(for our negro friends), hockey, and others. 85% of the men showed up. And they must have all made a pact to be assholes, and fucktards for the rest of their lives. The other 15% who didn't show up were spared. These creatures were also given a super power of thir own. They are able to transform into motherfuckers, backstabbers, two-faced liars for short times, thus, just like the women, it's a powerful ability, so won't last for too long, as it wears of, they turn back into the ordinary assholes that they were. 

What's with people? The governments of the world use scare tactics to fear the populations of the world into submission, and people submit. Pathetic little monkeys. Run little monkeys, go kill each other for your gods that don't even exist, go little monkeys, die for money, money that goes directly into the pockets of world leaders. Run monkeys, quickly, no no, don't ever ask questions like ""Why"", ""How"", ""That doesn't make any sense"", ""That's completly illogical"". Do as we say little human creatures.

"Where's Waldo? I think not! Where's Barbara is the true question!! - I was thinking of Barbara Borelli yesterday. 

I saw her in a dream. She was just standing their smiling at me. She looked like a princess. All in white clothes, and she was just smiling, the most beautiful smile, but didn't say anything, and i just looked at her, i tryed to look at her ears to see how many piercings she had by now, but couldn't see anything other than her face. There was a bright white light shining from all over, around her body, from the ground up, from the sky down, all over, a super bright white light. I couldn't stop looking in her eyes, it almost felt like if i stopped gazing into her eyes, that i would die. For a second i thought she was trying to tell me something, I wanted to run up to her and hold her, and touch her, to see if she was real, cuz' this dream felt different than others i've had. But i couldn't move. I wanted to look down to see if there was something holding my feet and keeping me from moving, but i couldn't take my eyes off her. 

It was weird. Cuz' usually I have dreams about people being murdered, hung, getting shot in the head, and stuff like that. Sometimes it's me that that stuff is happening to, and it's always dark and cold. But this was so different. 

I wonder what happened to her? She was a girl that went to my high school. We hardly ever spoke, we were in like two different groups of friends, so our paths rarely crossed. She always looks so preoccupied with stuff. I liked her, guess I should have told her or something, just to let her know and stuff, not that anything would have happened, but it would'a been nice. 

I wonder what she's up to? Maybe she owns her own business or something (seemed like something she'd like). It always made me smile when she went running down the halls, screaming at the top of her lungs, arms and legs flailing in every direction. Like some sort of escaped mental patient or something (I mean that in a good way). She was really sweet. (But loud) Bet if she ever stumbled upon my web page, she'd hunt me down and smack me for that. lol. 

Wonder if she'd have let me call her Bar-bar if we had been friends. Bar-bar sounds nice to me. Hey! Hey Bar-bar!! Where are you? You're not under my bed, or in my basement, or dancing on the roof!!

"Postal dude rulz - Wish they make Postal 3, like really really good. Postal 2 Share the Pain was o.k. but too childish, i want them to make a game so realistic, that it looks and feels like it's actually happening. Perhaps when they come out with Postal 4 (If they ever do) 

Not just the graphics, but there should be more to do, other than just shooting people for no reason, there needs to be a plot, and a good story line. But i doubt Vince Desi cares what i have to say :( 

And there should be music, a good soundtrack, with tunes from Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Disturbed, and many others, you know what kinda' bands we like. Mmmmmm, what else, what else? Make it longer, ummmmmm, you know the kind'a things i want, and also make a small additional game, just like the first postal game, but with graphics of today (that'll just be a little fun thingy on the side) All concentration showld be on the main game, guess it'll have to be for Postal 4 cuz' the 3rd ones already being made. 

Hope no one kills the makers of the Postal game, cuz' those guys rock. If someone does attack ""Running With Scissors"" or any of you guys, it'll be those religious fanatics, like those guys that kill abortion doctors and stuff, so watch out!! 

I also heard that the Postal movie was gonna suck, not that i know anything, but it's better to postpone production and make it really, really, really, good. Instead of rushing it. It shoul'd be a blockbuster movie, that everyone on earth wants to watch, or will want to watch after they here about it from their friends. 

You gotta bring Postal into the mainstream. I want more people to see what I see. By changing the format of the game and movie, you can do it. Just a little, the basis of Postal dude should stay the same, just gotta be a better story line. Lets get to know Postal dude's girlfriend, the places he worked at, the people that pissed him off, all that stuff, in detail, like a real kick ass game/movie 

(Postal dude was sad before he became angry and psychotic, that's the part we're never seen in the game. He was normal, but the world made him the way he became, gotta show that in the game and movie too)

The material world is a lie. For so long we have been taught that what’s important in life is to buy this and have that. To always have the latest fashion, biggest tv, fanciest car, nicest house, and blah,blah, blah. Well, the truth is we’ve become so attached to these things, our spiritual development has been halted. Just like they say in fight club “We become owned by the things we own”. Most people will spend hours standing in front of stores just to buy a new iphone. Those same people will complain about how they don’t have enough money but will always have money to spend on apple products. This attachment produces so much of the stress and worrying in the world today. I used to be like that, always concerned about what clothes I had, rather than whether or not I was happy. But not anymore. Since then I have learned the truth that such attachments are falsehoods and will only bring misery.This is my first blog post, there will be more to come.","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"
"Vester Flanagan Shooting 

As I’m sure you all know, a few days ago there was a shooting in Virginia. A man named Vester Flanagan opened fire on two former colleagues on live tv. He also recorded his own footage of the event. While reading about the event, I read some excerpts of his manifesto the media was releasing. And I have to say, anyone who knew him could have seen this coming. People like him have nothing left to live for, and the only thing left to do is lash out at a society that has abandoned them. His family described him as alone, no partner/lover. A victim not only of his own perception but also of our social media soaked enviroment. He posted the footage on facebook and twitter as well tweeting while he was running from the cops because he wanted the world to see his actions, much like many others post menial and trivial details of their life online and expect us to see it. Only his was at least a bit more interesting. 

On an interesting note, I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more your’re in the limelight. 

Sorry if this seems a bit disjointed, but these are just my thoughts on the matter. I thought I’d post this seeing as how my last blog post generated some good comments. 

Also, if anyone gets the chance, go on youtube and see the footage of him shooting those people. It’s a short video but good nonetheless. Will post more later","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"
"Houston Cop Shooting 

I just read about the houston cop shooting. Figured I’d post this since the response to my previous blog post on vester flanagan was so interesting. On the houston shooting it was reported that the suspect was influenced by black lives matter protests/movement. Although I don’t know if thats true, with all the issues about police and blacks/protestors in the news the past couple of years, it certainly seems like someone would be inspired to take action. With the constant chants of anti police rhetoric this was bound to happen. I don’t disagree that police brutality and excessive use of force is a problem, but killing an officer that never did anything to you is not the answer. 

This whole event seems similar to the one in new york earlier this year where that guy killed those two cops sitting in a parked car. The inflammatory rhetoric on both sides, whether warranted or not will only continue to agitate the situation and events such as these will happen more and more. These are just my thoughts on the matter. Will continue to post more blogs on related subjects, as well any interesting thoughts I may have. 

P.S. 
In case anyone’s wondering, I’m not on the side of the suspect, I’m on the side of the officer, and generally don’t agree with the black lives matter protests","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

"In a time long since, a time of repent, The Renaissance. In a quaint lonely town, sits a man with a frown. No job. No family. No crown. His luck had run out. Lost and alone. The streets were his home. His thoughts would solely consist of ""why do we exist?"" His only company to confide in was the vermin in the street. He longed for only one thing, the world to bow at his feet. They too should feel his secret fear. The dismal drear. His pain had made him sincere. He was better than the rest, all those ones he detests, within their castles, so vain. Selfish and conceited. They couldn't care less about the peasants they mistreated. They were in their own world, it was a joyous one too. That castle, she stood just to do all she could to keep the peasants at bay, not the enemy away. They had no enemies in their filthy orgy. And in her, the castles every story, was just another chamber of Lucifer's Laboratory. The world is a sandbox for all the wretched sinners. They simply create what they want and make themselves the winners. But the true winner, he has nothing at all. Enduring the pain of waiting for that castle to fall. Through his good deeds, the rats and the fleas. He will have for what he pleads, through the eradication of disease. So, to the castle he proceeds, like an ominous breeze through the trees. ""Stay back!"" The Guards screamed as they were thrown to their knees. ""Oh God, have mercy, please!"" The castle, she gasped and then so imprisoned her breath, to the shallow confines of her fragile chest. I'm on the lamb but I ain't no sheep. I am Death. And you have always been the sod. So repulsive and so odd. You never even deserved the presence of God, and yet, I am here. Around your cradle I plod. Came on foot, without shod. How improper, how rude. However, they shall not mind the mud on my feet if there is blood on your sheet. Now! Feel death, not just mocking you. Not just stalking you but inside of you. Wriggle and writhe. Feel smaller beneath my might. Seizure in the Pestilence that is my scythe. Die, all of you.","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

Like everyone, he advises to treat the symptoms rather than determining whatever causes there may be. Overall, he was fumbling around not saying anything meaningful. 

The way which this particular incident is being treated is frustrating to me.

From observing other people who have died, the only conclusion which can be reached is that nothing happens.

Perhaps I shouldn't have answered at all (especially considering how inaccurately I phrased it), but I'll try to describe what I meant: 

For anyone to give a meaningful answer to the fundamental question which I think you're asking (""Do you consider it generally desirable for someone to ask before kissing?"")  from which someone could potentially learn and modify their behavior accordingly, it would need to have an unimaginable number of variables and qualifiers. However, even if answers could be given for the impossibly detailed question, they would end up becoming meaningless because they would be so specific to the situation. That's why for the fundamental question to be reasonably asked, it understandably needs to include a particular scenario. In this case, it is a traditional end-of-date scenario between a potential romantic couple. That brings with it innumerable preconceived assumptions about the hypothetical relationship between the two people. We can only answer according to our interpretations of the context of the contrived relationship itself, eliminating the value of any of our answers. Basically, because of all of this, we can't accurately answer the question which you're really wanting to ask. 

I can't honestly answer with ""Maybe"". No matter how it is asked, I don't think that the fundamental question itself can ever be reasonably answered at all. Although it's possible that I'm genuinely not intelligent enough to figure out how I could provide an appropriate answer to the question.","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

"Jared Loughner(Tuscon Massacre) - being compared to Columbine? I haven't looked into this much in the past couple of years, but I can think of a few reasons as to why he killed 1 and injured 19. I vaguely remember reading that most of the injuries were inflicted to limbs, which are rarely fatal. I also remember him complaining about this: 
""When My Rifle Misfires And I Gotta Stand There For 60 Seconds Waiting For It To Fire, Or Not"". 
He was describing this: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_fire 
It's uncommon for high-quality ammunition to hang fire. If he] was using the same cheap cartridges for his massacre, then the bullets were likely full metal jacketed. Beyond that, his 9mm Beretta Cx4 Storm innately wasn't a particularly effective firearm. The difference in velocity between a 9mm rifle and 9mm pistol is usually 15% at best. The benefits which a 9mm rifle has for a novice are basically its reduced recoil and greater distance between the front and rear sights. It allows faster and more accurate shots, although that was inconsequential for Kimveer Gill if he was aiming as poorly as I assume he was.","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"
"Are you a virgin? - You believe that a degenerate capitalistic system results in a commodification of sexuality. This enables the creation of a cultural notion that premarital sexuality is acceptable. This results in sexuality becoming widespread. This has three primary consequences: 
The first is that there are some males who believe that the existence of this attitude of sexuality is a justification of date rape, which causes instances of it to increase. The second is that the existence of this attitude destroys the significance of marriages. Fewer people get married, and of the people who do get married, more divorce. The third is that the prevalence of sexuality results in more abortions, and more unwanted children, than would otherwise result. 
You believe that it would be desirable to outlaw premarital sex to cause a gradual cultural shift away from all of this. And I would like you to briefly elaborate on something so that I can better understand your position. What is it about marriage that appeals to you, and why do you oppose the prevalence of divorces?","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

"Lifetime Movie About Lauren Townsend's Mother? - He's the ultimate stalker. 
Events prior to and on February 16, 1988: 
Laura Black testified concerning defendant's efforts to establish a personal relationship with her. She recalled that they met in the spring of 1984. Soon thereafter, defendant invited her to socialize with him, but she declined. Defendant continued to extend social invitations to her without success, to call her on the telephone, to leave her gifts, and to attend her aerobics classes and company softball games. Black testified that she changed her residence three times between July 1985 and February 1988, but defendant obtained her new address each time, and surreptitiously obtained a key to one of these residences. Between the fall of 1984 and February 1988, she received approximately 150 to 200 letters from defendant, including two letters he sent to her parents' home in Virginia where she was visiting in December 1984. She had not provided him with her parents' address. Various employees of ESL attempted to stop defendant's harassment of Black, and defendant reacted either defiantly or by threatening to commit violent acts. 
After the January 1986 meeting with Tuffley and Lindauer, defendant confronted Black at her residence's parking lot. Black testified that defendant mentioned guns, told her he no longer was going to ask Black what to do and said he was going to tell her what to do. Black further testified that the weekend after this encounter, she received a letter from defendant stating he would not kill her, but referencing a whole range of options, each getting worse and worse.","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

This caused any video which might be arbitrarily construed as supporting the Columbine shooters to be removed.

Probably owing to watching too many mass murder movies, reading excerpts like this almost had me at the edge of my seat in anticipation:

On my way home to the farm I noticed what I believed to be a civilian police vehicle south of the southern town (30km from the farm). At this point in time I remembered I had forgotten to turn on the lights on the car since I tested out my blue LED lights the day before. Hmm, they should have stopped me for this violation. Very weird. As I came closer to the farm I noticed what I believed to be another civilian police car. Damn, I got a really bad feeling about this and my instincts told me I was about to be apprehended. Too many red flags were lit. I stopped 500 meters before the farm entrance and had a smoke, preparing mentally for a potential welcoming party at the farm. What should I do if I was about to be SWAT raped by a 6 or 12 man team? I didn't have any weapons available as they were all inside the main house. Should I make a run for it, if so, where would I go? Would I have time to fetch my evacuation kit, and should I try to get it and shoot my way out? 
After the break I approached the farm, and turned on the fog lights on the car so that I could have an advantage should they approach me from the front. I stopped 50 meters north of the main house and I was shocked at the sight that awaited me...! The barn door was wide open!!! Someone was here! They were probably circling me right now or waiting for me inside the main house! I waited 20 minutes with the fog light aimed straight at the direction I expected them to come from. Perhaps they are not here, maybe they just installed monitoring equipment like they often do? I entered the house, picked up the glock and searched the house and the barn. 
Nothing. I began searching for monitoring equipment, nothing... 
Paranoia can be a good thing, or it can be a curse. The barn door had probably been opened by the wind. I decided then and there that I would not allow paranoia to get the best of me again. If they were to come for me one day, there was really nothing I could do about it, so it would not be constructive to worry about it.

"Earliest movie portrayal of a mass/spree shooting? - 
I had known about Targets (1968) for a while, but I expected it to only tack on a Charles Whitman-style sniper to augment a plot which would have been too lame to stand on its own. I saw it yesterday, and I was surprised to find that the sniper was the main character, with the aging actor being the tacked-on character!

I don't know how I can describe it. It's like a blend of Bloody Wednesday and Stalking Laura. It isn't serious in the various ways that those two can be taken (Yes, I just called Bloody Wednesday serious in some sense), while still being sincere. It's like what Duck! should have been. I think it's the most pleasurable movie about a mass shooting that I've seen. And I can forgive the movie for including the incredibly-lame subplot because of how lightheardedly-awesome the climax of its intersection with the sniper is. If you watch it, I recommend skipping any scene which doesn't include the Charlie clone; at best, you'll only be missing some pretentious pseudo-philosophizing about aesthetics.

Anyway, it made me wonder if it was the earliest portrayal of a mass/spree shooting. Before hearing about Targets, I thought that Thriller: A Cruel Picture was the earliest one (deliberately ignoring If....). As far as I know, Thriller is still the earliest movie which portrays a trench-coated shooter (with the ""criminal aura"", not the ""detective aura""). Does anyone know of any earlier ones, for either of the two categories? Today I saw The Sniper (1952), which was released when Charles Whitman was still a wee Boy Scout, but the main character was more of a serial killer. Despite that disappointment, it was still excellent and presciently anticipated future psychological horrors.

Now that I think of it, I'm sure that Charles Whitman must have snuck into a showing of The Sniper and eventually ended up imitating what he saw. After all, the sniper in the movie used a variant of an M1 carbine, which was one of the rifles that was brought up the Austin tower. What has the media done to our children?","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"
"Earliest movie portrayal of a mass/spree shooting? - The trailer seems to agree with my evaluation. The subplot character is thrown onto the last ten seconds as if to say, ""Hey, look! We've got some famous actor for whom we'll contrive the faintest justification to include!"" 
And upon further inspection, I think I've recovered a deleted scene from some alternative universe in Back To The Future.

"Pumped Up Kicks - The guy who wrote Pumped Up Kicks said that the song is about an outcast teenager losing his mind while plotting revenge without any explicit violence occurring. People have interpreted that to mean that it's about a school shooting. Because of the name Robert, Robert Hawkins has now become a stereotypical poster child of school shootings. If any name other than ""Robert"" had been used for the song, no one would have associated Robert Hawkins with Pumped Up Kicks. If the name ""Robert"" had still been in the song, but Robert Hawkins had actually been 32 years old (the average age of American mass murderers in the last 20 years), again, no one would have associated him with Pumped Up Kicks. They would have instead said that ""Pumped Up Kicks is surely about Robert Steinhauser"", not at all because he fits in with it better than anyone else would have, but merely because his name was ""Robert"". At least with Robert Steinhauser, it almost sort of vaguely fits in with the interpretation many people have that the song is about school shootings. 
Robert Hawkins's mass murder unquestionably was not a school shooting: he shot up an upscale shopping store. Without applying my pet theory as to the origin of mass murder, which you're accusing me of doing, anyone can see that Robert Hawkins did explicitly share the socioeconomic characteristics of much older mass murderers. Instead of approaching it through simply stereotyping him as a school shooter who was bullied by his classmates, it would thus be more accurate to approach it through simply stereotyping him as maybe being a young version of Mark Barton, with whom he shared many similarities. 
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/i-don ... 09610.html If you interpret Pumped Up Kicks to be about school shootings and you think that Robert Hawkins is a better representation for a song about ""an outcast teenager losing his mind while plotting revenge without any explicit violence"" than Evan Ramsey or Michael Carneal would have been; and if you think that Pumped Up Kicks has more to do with Robert Hawkins in particular than the Omaha Shopping Mall Blues does, then I don't know what I can say. 
It's akin to saying that I Don't Like Mondays was about Charles Whitman. I mean, in a sense I guess it could be, but it would be absurd to say that it's a better representation of him than it is of Brenda Spencer; and if you want to think of I Don't Like Mondays being about Charles Whitman, it would be absurd to say that this song,

"Pumped Up Kicks - Other than the whole ""Robert"" thing, the only indication that Pumped Up Kicks could be about Robert Hawkins in particular is that he used his stepfather's Kalashnikov; but that's not something unique to him because, according to the best information that I have available, around 75% of American n <25-year-old mass shooters used firearms which they didn't legally own, compared to around 25% of American >24-year-old mass shooters. Instead of being an explicit reference to Robert Hawkins, it could just be a throwaway reference to a common aspect of young mass shooters.
Anyway, diverging from my whining, I serendipitously rediscovered Robert C. Bonelli Jr. after having forgotten about him for a while.
http://goathillstudio.com/albums/media% ... oto_13.jpg
The only explicit information that I could find about him regarding his teenage years was that he had dropped out of high school at age 16. At age 24, he was an extremely shy outsider who was constantly worried about being picked on for being reportedly 260 pounds at 5'10"". His duplex neighbor said that he was ""the kind of kid who gets picked on in high school"". His uncle said that he had an inferiority complex, always being selfconscious about the way he looked, his weight, and how no girl would ever want him. Along with being depressed for many previous years, he had been having trouble with alcohol and drug abuse.
He spent almost all of his time alone in his room where he kept ""a shrine of Columbine memorabilia"", which included newspaper clippings, ""TV documentaries about 'the darker side' of Columbine"", and news accounts & pictures printed from the internet, along with a picture of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold taped to his wall. He had a video which included him building and exploding pipe bombs with two other local dropouts, one of whom's girlfriend said that he had frequently spoken about killing himself.
It's rumored that he also had multiple bootlegs of the album which contains this song
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6sZokeNzYw&t=16s
If he didn't actually have it, I'm sure that he would have if he had known about it. He repeatedly took cocaine early in the morning of Sunday, February 13, 2005. Possibly precipitated by a girl rejecting his friendship several days earlier, he decided to kill himself. Dressed in black, he left a suicide note at his house, borrowed his father's car, and drove to the Hudson River with the Hesse Model 47 he had legally bought at a gun show four months earlier. He held the rifle to his head but couldn't kill himself. He drove around aimlessly, and saw a police car in the parking lot of the Hudson Valley Mall in Kingston, New York. He decided to get the police to publicly kill him.
He wrote a second suicide note at some point and left it in his car. The only information I could find on either of them was from the second one, which included the Dylan quote, ""The lonely man strikes with absolute rage"". He had written somewhere (I don't know any details) that he had been wanting to do this before the Columbine anniversary. About an hour prior to the shooting, he went to a Walmart to buy ammunition and returned to the mall. He considered waiting until the coming Monday to do it at a school, but demonstrably decided against it. He parked in front of the Best Buy (presumably the most convenient entrance, going by Google satellite) and sat in his car for twenty minutes. Just before 3:15 PM, he picked up his rifle and walked toward the mall.
He shot three times at the front door, which caused ricocheting bullet fragments and shrapnel to superficially hit his first victim. The victim's daughter's purse and pants were each penetrated once, but she remained uninjured. Once he entered the Best Buy, he spent the next seven minutes aimlessly shooting in the store. He never shot from the shoulder and most of the bullets struck the ceiling and floor. The most aiming he did involved shooting from his hip at televisions and blank walls. He had many opportunities to shoot people but bypassed all of them. He reloaded once and eventually left the Best Buy, entering the main corridor where he spent the next two minutes shooting out store displays while walking toward the center of the mall. It was here that he shot his second victim in the knee. When he had expended all of his ammunition, he dropped his rifle and calmly surrendered. He was subsequently sentenced to 32 years in prison. Robert Bonelli and Robert Hawkins (who both went by Robbie) both used AK-47 variants (although Bonelli's was a very cheap model), and both of them had two 30-round magazines (although Bonelli's weren't fancily jungle-taped together like Hawkins's). While Robert Hawkins used 2/3 of it and killed eight people and injured four, Robert Bonelli used all of it, but only directly shot one person and indirectly shot a second. The only time that I'm aware of Robert Hawkins deliberately shooting at anything other than a human was when he shot a teddy bear, but none of Robert Bonelli's shots were deliberate. Likewise, I cannot seeing anything which indicated that Robert Hawkins had been significantly affected by (the conventional interpretation of) bullying nor peer rejection, but Robert Bonelli seems to be a different case.
If any ""Robert"" fits in with the school shooting interpretation of the song about ""an outcast teenager losing his mind while plotting revenge without any explicit violence"", it's Robert Bonelli, not Robert Hawkins. The only issue is that he was 24 years old, not a teenager; but Robert Hawkins was practically the same age, being less than a half a year from 20. Anyway, ""teenager"" was my word, with the Pumped Up Kicks guy always saying ""kid"" and ""youth"".
Robert Bonelli still doesn't fit in with it better than Evan Ramsey or Michael Carneal would. And Pumped Up Kicks is still a really lame song","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

"Dreams - Today I dreamt a Columbine reference for the first time. I've probably never had one before because I've scarcely ever cared about Columbine. 
I began my dream by waking up at age 14 in my extremely dark bedroom during a power outage. I knew that there were ghoulies outside my locked door, roaming around the rest of the house. I tried to get my pocket flashlight to work, but it wasn't consistently staying on. Replacement batteries didn't help, so I instead tried using my backup flashlight: a partially-filled roll of dimes. I spent a while fumbling around with loose dimes, trying to fill up the roll, and eventually ""my brother"" came up to the other side of the locked door. He told me that he needed my help with the ghoulies. I was saying, ""Oh, fuck off. I know you're not my brother. You yourself are one of the ghoulies"", as I was continuing to fumble around trying to fill the roll of dimes. I ended up not having enough dimes to entirely fill it, but at least I had enough for it to give off a dim ray of light. I got out of bed and prepared for a fight with the ghoulies. I went downstairs as my flashlight dreamvanished, but at this point the rest of the house was dimly lit anyway. As I was about to go into the kitchen, a huge purple monster with long arms leapt forth from around a corner and pinned me against a wall. It sort of looked like this: http://www.raukusbaukus.com/images/grap ... ilcher.jpg 
I realized that it was some student I knew when I was 12. He tried talking to me, and basically said something to the extent of, ""Everyone picked on me for being a huge purple monster, and so now I'm going to go Columbine. I already went to a bunch of other kids' houses to find a partner, but they refused my offer, so I ate them. You're next on the list. Do you want to join me?"". The way it apparently worked was that I could get bitten by him and then choose which form I wanted to be in at will. I thought, why not get bitten by him so I could become a cool purple monster whenever I pleased, and then just use my new monster powers to kill him right after he bites me? So I was like, ""Sure, bro"". He kept trying to bite different parts of me, but it always ended in me whining, ""Ooowwwwww"", he would let go, look at the spot, and say, ""I didn't bite long enough! It didn't work"". We went through this for quite a while, and then I had the thought that, ""You shouldn't just bite me -anywhere-. It should be high up on my arm so people don't see the mark, the same reason why doctors inject patients on their arm (dream logic). He rolled up my sleeve, pointed at my vein, and I said, ""No! Doctors would find out because they inject there, of course! It has to be higher"". He kept pointing to various places as we were walking around the house, but none of them seemed suitable to me. He gradually dream-changed into having an awfully-constructed syringe in his hand with all sorts of bent needles all over it, and I procrastinated by getting him to talk about the music he liked. I had decided at this point that I should just kill him rather than wait to get turned into a cool therianthrope because his needles were really starting to freak me out. Then I realized, ""Hey, if you were feigning my brother's voice, then that means you must have killed him!"" 
I ran down to the basement as he was assuring me he hadn't done anything, and I saw my brother soundly asleep. I went back up the stairs and saw an opportunity to kill the huge purple monster, seeing as he had transformed into a cardboard box. I shred apart the box as dawn approached while he was complaining about how confusing I was. ""All the other students just screamed at me, but you accepted me, and now what are you doing? You're tearing me apart!"", and I told him to shut up or something like that as I tore apart the last bit of cardboard. 
My brother walked up the stairs, but it wasn't really him! He had been brainwashed into believing that he was someone else from my childhood, whom I'll call Billy, and he had even been made up to look sort of like him. I asked him who he thought he was, and sure enough he said Billy, and that he was moving away to college. I followed him into the garage, trying to find a way to convince him that he wasn't Billy before it was too late. Once I entered the garage, my nonexistent kindergarten-age sister was blocking my path while crying for some reason. I affectionately embraced her in my arms and tenderly kissed her. She woefully said, ""I don't want you to kiss me"" as her crying got worse. I was annoyed that she had been brainwashed into thinking there was something evil about kissing, so I picked her up and tossed her over the railing into a pile of cardboard boxes several feet below.
Heroically getting back to the task at hand, I looked out at the open garage door, where there were all sorts of non-existent relatives assembling outside in the full-blown morning. There was some fictional high-status male family member at the garage door reading from a scroll in his hands. He was giving the eulogy for my ""dead"" brother! There were some assorted people in the garage who were walking toward the outside, and I saw that among them were two pastors. My horror movie experience indicated that pastors help with all sorts of ghoulie problems, so I called them over and explained that my brother wasn't actually dead. They were shocked and agreed to help stop the ceremony. One of them followed me toward the eulogizer, but at this point, the garage was significantly larger and was extremely crowded, to the extent where I couldn't even pass anyone. Everyone stopped walking as they turned to look behind us at someone who was walking forward. It was apparently her birthday, so the only logical thing to do was hum the wedding march. The pastor and I sighed as we hummed with them, waiting for them to move forward again. The song ended, she stopped, and said, ""I'm glad that you're all
here today"".
Various views of multiple explosions went through my mind, and at the end of it, a thirdperson overhead stationary view showed some WASPs in a residential park doing all sorts of recreational activities. Text appeared saying, ""At least now there was plenty of space for racquetball"". I realized that I had been watching a YouTube video, part 11/11. I thought, ""Wow, that was a pretty surreal movie. I'm bookmarking this and I'll go back to look at the other parts later"". I woke up in real life and realized that YouTube would remove the videos from their website along with all internet references to them by the time that I managed to get online, so I typed this for posterity.","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

Well, not anymore! Now they're afraid of me!"""". And at 53:25, I think we've heard that a bunch of times:

"Anxiety and fear in American society: a history -
Elisabell wrote:
Fact is: school shootings are not common occasions, and have steadily decreased from their peak.
It is incredibly debatable whether or not societal factors had an effect or in some way influenced Columbine, and to be honest I think it wouldn’t have made any difference if the high school was a utopia. I see it as two teenagers who were not well in any sense of the word acting for little to no reason whatsoever.
Honestly the “society is shitty” commentary just seems a little much for me. Unless I’m misunderstanding your point.
""I could go in a hundred different ways with this, but I'll try to make it as entirely relevant to AS55's post as I can, instead of rambling about chimpanzees and who-knows-what-else. Columbine wasn't an isolated incident: it was the apex of a string of school shootings which began increasing with Lu Gang and Wayne Lo in the early 1990s. Despite American students committing fewer school shootings in 2000-2009 than they did in 1990-1999, the rate of attempts actually increased beyond their pre-Columbine level. Columbine caused Americans to begin taking the potential for school shootings seriously, and thus many attempts which were expected to have been carried out have instead been prevented. And since 1999, there has been an increase in foreign school massacres committed in countries where, as Sabratha's Bullet Time phrases it, there isn't the """"operational history"""" of Columbine.
In any event, it's myopic to telescope on school shootings when they've comprised a small percentage of the larger trend of mass murders, which are carried out in all sorts of contexts; but they always occur in contexts which involve some permutation of alienation, which has been part and parcel with societal """"progress"""". This relationship can be seen with the Chinese mass stabbings. There were some sparse incidents throughout the 20th century, but the rate began to rise in the 1990s and erupted in the early 2000s, corresponding to China's rapid """"economic development"""", culminating in the infamous spate of elementary school stabbings of 2010.
American mass murders were less prevalent before Richard Speck precipitated their rise in 1966. My best estimate for the -absolute- minimum amount of mass murders in the US since 1966 is 960. I would be surprised if there weren't a minimum of somewhere around 1500 in reality, but we'll just vaguely say that there have been over 1000. If you were trying to measure alienation in a society, what could be a more blatant indication? And it's glib to dismiss them as not being indicative of anything just because there have been over a thousand of them instead of over a hundred thousand, or however many you think are necessary, because mass murdering is so ridiculously over-the-top of a response that very few people are prone to do it under any circumstances. But just look at how many fans you can find for all different types of mass murderers""not just the Reb & VoDkA bunch"", and beyond these fans are countless more people who can sympathize with them; and beyond these are millions more who never think of relating the circumstances of their lives to anyone else but instead just go through the motions of life incessantly dissatisfied with their environment.
Thinking of this society as the default state of existence is the reason why you think that humans would be """"not well"""" for """"no reason whatsoever"""". Civilization has not been present for 99% of the existence of hominids, and the only way that it's ever sustained is by indoctrinating each new child for years on end. The """"wellness"""" that you speak of is solely defined by a child's submission to this process and their subsequent capacity to propagate civilization themselves. When civilization exists in a form where all forms of alienation (among many other things) are rampant, as can be seen in the most recent incarnation within the last fifty years which AS55 talked about, new children will end up """"not well"""" in all sorts of ways. You don't even have to touch a topic as cryptic as mass murder to see an indication of this: you can look at a single symptom as egregious as the proliferation of antidepressants. And look in your own life. You've said that you're afflicted by unrelenting anxiety and that you're afraid to leave your house. Do you really think that the way you feel is not symptomatic of anything other than your own inexplicable defectiveness?

"Hello all.
My name is Jeff Weise, a Native American from the Red Lake ""Indian"" reservation in Minnesota. I'm interested in joining the group, as I support your ideals and even though I am young, I still want to join. What is the age requirement (if any)?","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"
"Thank you.
What brings me to the forum? Well, I stumbled across the site in my study of the Third Reich as well as Nazism, amongst other things. I guess I've always carried a natural admiration for Hitler and his ideals, and his courage to take on larger nations. I also have a natural dis-like for communism.

When I was growing up, I was taught (like others) that Nazi's were (are) evil and that Hitler was a very evil man ect... Of course, not for a second did I believe this. Upon reading up on his actions, the ideals and issues the German Third Reich adressed, I began to see how much of a lie had been painted about them. They truly were doing it for the better.   

It kind of angers me how people pass pre-judgement on someone if they even so much as say   something like ""I support what Hitler did,"" without even hearing what you have to say. This goes double if you're ethnic. I also hear things like, ""oh he had syphilis, he was crazy and thats why he did what he did."" Or, ""he molested his neice,"" it's easy to see that even today people are trying to destroy the image of a man who deserves great respect...   ","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

By the way, I'm being blamed for  a threath on t he school I attend because someone say they were going to shoot up the school on 4/20, Hitlers birthday, and just because i claim being a National Socialist, guess whom they've pinned?","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"
"You encounter a lot of hostility when you claim to be a National Socialist, but because of my size and appearance people don't give me as much trouble as they would if I looked weak. I already had a fist fight with a communist not to long ago over me being what I am (I also won), but it was worth it. I don't try to hide what I am from anyone, if they're going to start something over it then fine, I'm not backing down; Nor am I hiding. I try not to  be aggressive in most situations, I'll use force if I have to, but I'm not about to go out and pick a fight. I'm mostly defensive, I'll defend myself if someone tries something but other than that I'm a peaceful person.

But the school threath passed and i was cleared as a suspect , I'm glad for that. I don't much care for jail, I've never been ther and i don't plan on it.

Either way, I was wondering if there was a way to become  a more active member, besides posting on this board I can't really think of anything else to do. I could do some recruiting, but a lot of the people I socialize with are against Nazism whole-heartedly, I managed to sway a few opinions in the favor of the movement none the less. and there is also a few of my ""friends"" who only like Hitler because they think Nazi's are ""cool"". Which I agree with, don't get me wrong, but they aren't as serious about it as I am.

Any ideas?

"Apparently a lot of people have never heard of a Native  American National  Socialist, which surprises me. 

I think most people on this Reeservation would respond well to the racial questionif it was disguised.

Now for some reason. I would find myself asking ""if you're so proud to be native, then why do you walk,talk,act and dress like an African American?""

But i always refrain from doing so.

The only one's who oppose my views are the teachers at the high school, and a large portion of the student body who think a Nazi is a Klansman, or a White Supremacist thug.

Most of the Natives I know have been poisoned by what they were taught in school. The basic ""Nazi = Bad, Jew = Good, Defend Jew at all costs."" You get the idea, the public school system has done more hram then good, and as a result it has left many on this reservation misled and misinformed.

But you are right about us Natives having a lot of pride in our heritage. I own my share of ""Native Pride"" shirts and sweaters, and I see many more in  school, yet they are still outnumbered by your basic Rap culture paraphermalia.

I haven't given too much thought to they way out land would be divided or how it would work, so thanks for bringing it up.

What ways has the jewish power affected us in General? Ever since the Jewish post-war propanganda has been taught in our school system (on reservations), a lot have been brainwashed into thinking purity is wrong, at least that's my take on it. I can't help but notice how many pure blooses Natives there are left since..

Sorry if I didn't answer some of the questions in the ways you had hoped, but I'm a little tired right now. I'd be happy to field anymore questions you may have for me though. ","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"
"Anymore Native American NS's? Not right now, though I'm thinking of recruiting a few for the party once school starts up again.

About the wannabe's, I call them ""n-iggers,"" since technically that's what they are. Native -Iggers, though I tend not to use the term so much in public for obvious reasons.

Right now I know about two people on the Rez who share my beliefs, but they don't share them entirely.

The teachers at my school are all white (besides the Ojibwe language teacher). yet the times I have brought up that Native Women and Black men or White women and Native men shouldn't be together to keep their blood pure, I've been called a racist. When I bring up the point that out tribe (the Ojibwe) is mixed a lot and is in need of more pure bloods, I get the same old argument which seems to be so common around here. ""We need to mix all the races, to combine all the strengths... "" ect ect. It gets old real quick when you hear the same argument over and over.

they (teachers) don't openly say that racial purity is wrong, yet when you speak your mind on the subject you get ""silenced"" real quick by the teachers and likemindede school officials..","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"

"They pegged me as a possible school shooter earlier this year, or wait, that was last month.

Apparently someone was supposed to shoot up the school on 4/20, and there was a lot of buzz around me, and for good reasons I guess.   

I wear combat boots (with my pant legs tucked into them), wear a trench coat, and at the last basketball game my friend Mac, (who happens to wear a black trench coat like mine), did a ""Sieg Heil"" during the national anthem (for shock value), so they had us pegged as ""Trench Coat Mafia."" My ""friend"" Rose even said that I fit the profile of a school shooter that she saw on 60 minutes. They also pinned it on me because 4/20 happens to be Adolf Hitler's birthday, and I seem to be the only one who promotes National Socialist beliefs (not the stereotypical ""White Power"" bs you hear racists shouting, either). So it's not hard to label a school shooter.   

I happen to be ""not so popular,"" Gothic (in the sense that I wear nothing but black, spike my hair in ""devil"" horns, and listen to music like Cradle of Filth and KoRn), and happen to be an emotionally disturbed person, if you could call me that. So it's really no problem slapping a label on someone because they fit the stereotype. And no, I wasn't the one who did the threat. On ""Game day"" (4/20) the Feds were all around the place, watching, cop cars on nearly every corner around the school and a few large unmarked black vans sitting around, I bet they were on standby. So they WERE prepared for something to happen.   

(PS, I'm not a white supremacist, can't even spell it, I'm a Native American, Ojibwa, living on the Redlake Indian Reservation in Minnesota, and lets not have this turn into a hardcore political discussion about my political ideals, ok? )

"I wasn't sure what Forum to post this in, because it confuses me a lot and has me wondering, but I'll take a guess and post it here in the Paranormal Forum.

A few months ago, when I was on my way back from the Theif River mental health clinic after a suicide attempt, I saw something that I thought was severly out of place.

1.) It was an Owl, sitting in plain site in the brush near the road, I saw him/her clearly, and to boot it was White. A White Owl in the middle of the day sitting next to the road.

I didn't think too much about it till about two months later, I asked my grandmother about it.

She told me a story that scared the scheisse out of me.

She said, one time when her and a friend  were there way from somewhere ( I forget, since it's not really that important of a detail), her friend saw an Owl in the middle of the day during their drive. They were on their way to the casino, she said her friend mentioned the Owl to her but neither paid any attention to it.

They were sitting in the casino playing their favourite game when my grandmothers friend (same one who had witnessed the Owl), fell to the ground. She had had a heart attach, long story short, she didn't make it. Period.

Now when I heard this, I must've looked like a carton of milk I was so white from fear,

""That was the only experience I ever had with an Owl being seen during the day,"" she said.

I always heard seeing an Owl during the daytime was an Omen of some sort, since Owls are a night bird, but doing some research on the net I didn't find out what exactly they are an omen for, but rather, that they have always (for the most part) been associated with evil forces.

Now I posted this here to hopefully gain some insite from the more spiritually affluent peoples of the board.

I want to know: am I screwed?
What does  the Omen mean.
And, should i be worried?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, as I'm still worried over this whole thing... Any help would be greatly appreciated.]","1.0","SchooshooterTexts"
"I had went through a lot of things in my life that had driven me to a darker path than most choose to take. I split the flesh on my wrist with a box opener, painting the floor of my bedroom with blood I shouldn't have spilt. After sitting there for what seemed like hours (which apparently was only minutes), I had the revelation that this was not the path.

It was my decision to seek medical treatment, as on the other hand I could've chose to sit there until enough blood drained from my downward lascerations on my wrists to die.   

I am now on Anti-depressants, and just because you've probably never been through anything like I have doesn't give you the right to say what you have.
